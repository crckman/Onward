# Onward (High than High)

As music is one of the great passions in my life, I've put together this playlist to share.  While my favorites span a variety of genres, this playlist is decidedly "rock".

If you have a free spotify account, you'll hear a shuffled version with other songs included.  In otherwords, you'll need a [premium account](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/) in order to hear the playlist.

In typical fashion, I've annotated this playlist with some rambling notes:
