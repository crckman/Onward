    "Also, this is one of those annoying songs that incudes some *French* (not much, but given the song consists of only twelve distinct words, its hard to ignore).  Anyway, the phrase is `\"Un peu d'air sur la terre\"` and can be loosely translated to mean `\"a puff of dust\"` in reference to the effect of a tennis ball striking the ground of a clay court.\n",
