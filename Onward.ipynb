    "For me, great rock tends to be (hopefully) a bit gratuitous, sometimes cryptic, and often empowering.  I hope you enjoy.\n",

    "begins with the tuning of *French* horns,\n",
    "and is based on the tennis player *Andy Roddick*, who had the fastest serve in the world but (at the time) had't won anything (Tennis:French Open).  Yes, its too clever, by two...but that's *Foals*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is one of those annoying songs that incudes some *French* (not much, but given the song consists of only twelve distinct words, its hard to ignore).  Anyway, the phrase is `\"Un peu d'air sur la terre\"` and can be loosely translated to mean `\"a puff of dust\"` in reference to the effect of a tennis ball striking the ground of a clay court.\n",

    "This songs starts up with a deceptively simple structure but is entirely infectious with a nice touch of dissonance.\n",

    "*Foals* is a band I've very much enjoyed seeing live over the past decade so when I realized they weren't on the playlist...well, it just didn't seem right.  In terms of any potential deeper meaning, this could be seen as a self-critique."
